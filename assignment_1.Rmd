I am taking this course to solidify my data science foundation. ESM 206 and 244 were experiences that educated and challenged me, and I believe a computing class can further my data science skills. Working with environmental data is something I plan to be doing post-Bren so I think this class can further my abilities as an environmental science practitioner. Also I wanted to take a class with Dr. Tague during my time here.

My data science (other then some excel experience) comes from my time at Bren (ESM 206, ESM 244, and GIS). Spatial and ecological data is of particular interest to me. Doing spatial analysis outside of Arc and enhancing my data science skills as applied to population biology are of particular interest.
